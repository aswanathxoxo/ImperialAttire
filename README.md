# ImperialAttire
Imperial Attire is a fully functional e-commerce website for a clothing brand, created as our first collaborative team project. Our goal was to develop a user-friendly and secure online shopping platform where users can explore a range of fashion items, add them to their cart, and complete purchases easily.

Project Features and Functionality
User Account Management:

Users can create an account and securely log in, allowing access to the shopping platform with personal data protection.
Once logged in, users can view their profile, browse products, and manage their purchases.
Product Catalog and Shopping Cart:

The platform offers a diverse selection of clothing items, displayed with descriptions, prices, and images to enhance the shopping experience.
Users can add products to their cart, review selected items, adjust quantities, and proceed to checkout smoothly.
Admin Dashboard for Product Management:

A separate admin login grants authorized access to a dashboard for managing the product catalog.
Admins can add new products, update existing ones with the latest information or images, and delete items, keeping the catalog current.
Technologies and Tools Used
This project was our first experience with Java full-stack development, allowing us to learn and utilize several key technologies:

Spring Boot for building back-end functionality and handling business logic.
Maven for efficient project and dependency management.
JSP (JavaServer Pages) for creating dynamic web pages and rendering content.
MySQL as the database solution, securely managing user data, product information, and transaction details.
Team Members
The 'About' section highlights our team members and their individual contributions to this project. Completing this first project together was a valuable learning experience, giving each of us practical knowledge in Java full-stack development.

Below, we have included screenshots of the website to showcase the design, functionality, and overall user experience of Imperial Attire.
